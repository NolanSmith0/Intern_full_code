# Intern_full_code
This Repo is used as supplementary material for Jiahe Wang's MFE and MQF application

---

This repo stores my code for my Intern work, mostly about web scrping works.

File list:

- ```企查查爬虫.ipynb``` : jupyter notebook, scraper for [企查查](https://www.qcc.com/), a Chinese website offering company information search and business data analysis services.
- ```天眼查爬虫.ipynb``` : jupyter notebook, scraper for [天眼查](https://www.tianyancha.com/), a Chinese website offering company information search and business data analysis services.
- ```搜索查询v2.0``` : jupyter notebook, scraper for collecting search result in Baidu and Google(baidu is a Chinese search engine).
- ```linajia/``` : directory, my scraper project for collecting all history housing deal and rent data from (lianjia)[https://www.lianjia.com/city/], a Chinese housing trading platform. I collected all 8 millon data and I can't upload all since it is too big(exceeding Github's 100 MB limit), so I shared a sample data of 100,000 rows called ```sample_data.csv```.

For more detailed description of the code, pls check the code, the name of each function says its function. And there is Chinese in the code since I wrote this for my boss.
