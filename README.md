This Repo is used as supplementary material for Jiahe Wang's MFE and MQF application

---

There three files in this repo, two are basically same(企查查爬虫, 天眼查爬虫), '企查查' and '天眼查' are two websites for querying various information about companies in mainland China. And since I word in the primary market investment department, my boss has a need for collecting unlisted companies' info. The code is simple, search the company name in the company list, enter the company page and collect its business and share holder info, save the result.

The third file, ```搜索查询v2.0```, (search query in English), is a Web Crawler for collecting search result in Baidu and Google(baidu is like Chinese Google), simple code, search company name, collect the result amount, search next. I added multithreading in this part.

For more detailed description of the code, pls check the code, the name of each function says its function. And there is Chinese in the code since I wrote this for my boss.
